# VBA---challenge-
# this was a challenge from the Penn Data Science Bootcamp. The goal was to loop through worksheets of an excel file that contained years of data peratining to stocks. 
# the code loops through each worksheet and creates a table on the right side of the sheet that summarizes each stock. There is also conditional formatting that highlights the cells red or green depending on if their value is positive or negative
